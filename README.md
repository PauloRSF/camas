# Camas

**Camas** is a Redis client library for Rust.

This is by no means production code. It's just a fun little exercise to learn a bit more about the Redis protocol.

## How to run the examples

Before running any examples, you need to spin up a [Redis](https://redis.io) instance bound to `localhost:6479`. Then, you can run any example as usual (e.g.: `cargo run --example main`)
